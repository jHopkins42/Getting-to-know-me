# Getting-to-know-me
First off, my name is Jeremy Hopkins
I'm into a lot of things, but after talking with someone in the IT department of my workplace, I realized something:
   I do actually enjoy building graphical interfaces and websites.
   
I have a little experience in journalism, where I got to play with pre-established web pages and styles, 
and got to "peek behind the curtain" when setting up news articles (I was the campus editor for the paper, out of five campuses), and got to experiment with the CSS codes to make an article pop/flow better.
While I won't consider myself an expert (I firmly believe in humility, as there's always someone who can teach you something)
I do acknowledge that I have some skill.  This can be a problem, as sometimes our sense of self and skill confidence
prevents us from seeing what else might be out there that's better or more efficient, among other options.

Sorry, didn't mean to drop some philosophical musings in the blurb about "who I am," but I don't know if there isn't a better
place to ask "who am I" than a "who are you" section.

So, to give the big picture for a moment:  I am someone who is interested in philosophy, web development, games, writing (of 
pretty much all types), music, computer games, reading, cars, wood working, leather working, and general crafts.  
While the pandemic has hampered face-to-face meetings somewhat, I am a Demo Agent for Catalyst Game Labs in their Shadowrun
game line (Table Top Role Playing Games) and also have been a GM (Game Master) for this and other Role Playing Games (RPGs).
In addition to playing these games, I also organize and run them, which is a little bit of time management, small group leadership, creative thinking, random decision making with limited resources, long-term planning, and general social skills.
(You learn to read a crowd as a GM, trying to balance story elements with time available.  You also learn how much acting
you need to do - both physical and voice - to retain a crowd's interest.)

And if that wasn't enough, I also record some of these sessions and release an Actual Play Podcast of the story for others 
to enjoy, under the brand name "ShadowRum Podcast."  (It is under a Creative Commons license as Topps Company, Inc., owns the
